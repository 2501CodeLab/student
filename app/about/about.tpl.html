<p>The LT Student App is a portal to resources tailored specifically to Lane Tech students. Built to be responsive for smartphones.</p>
        <p>You can find various sources of info, such as the school calendar, which will appear compact on your phone. You can also check here to see if there are any special bell schedules for today. We even connect to Lane Tech's database to gather information
            like the amount of demerits you have, or even see your grades from previous grade levels.</p>
